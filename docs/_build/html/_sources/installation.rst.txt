Installation
================================

For Unix based systems:

#. Install Cython module: https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/src/quickstart/install.html. You would also need ``numpy`` module for `pyrh`.
#. Define an environment variable `CC` and `CXX` to point to the GCC compiler that is compatible for CPU architecture.
#. Run ``python setup.py install`` and check for any possible errors. 

If everything went without any error, you have functional `pyrh` module! Now, lets compute some spectra!
